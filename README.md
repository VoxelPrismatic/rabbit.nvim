Quickly jump between buffers

---

This tool tracks the history of buffers opened in an individual window. With a quick motion, you can be in any one 
of your last twenty buffers without remembering any details.

Unlike other tools, this remembers history *per window*, so you can really jump quickly.

### Why
1. [theprimeagen/harpoon](https://github.com/theprimeagen/harpoon) requires explicit adding of files, which is too much effort
2. Telescope:buffers doesn't remember history. You still have to remember what your last file was
3. Same applies with `:ls` and `:b`


### Install
I don't know what I'm doing yet. I just have this in my lazy plugins folder and return `{}` so it doesn't scream at me.
